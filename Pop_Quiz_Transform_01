Statement) Which CSS transform property is used to scale an element both horizontally and vertically?
scaleX
scaleY
scale
resize

-----------------------------

SOLUTION = Correct Answer: scale.

scale property: The scale() function within the transform property is used to uniformly scale an element both horizontally and vertically. It accepts one or two numerical values as parameters:

One value: Scales both width and height equally.
Two values: The first value scales the width, and the second value scales the height.
Other scaling properties:

scaleX(): Scales only the width of the element.
scaleY(): Scales only the height of the element.
resize: This property is not a CSS transform property. It's a non-standard property related to user resizing of elements, but it has limited browser support and is not recommended for general use.
