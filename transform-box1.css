Statement) You have a box numbered 1. Apply a combination of two Transform properties on line 15

rotate(360deg) scale(2)

------------------------
SOLUTION = .box {
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 2em;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 100px 100px;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: purple;
    transition: transform 1s;
}

.box:hover {
    /* Your code goes here */
    /* Assuming the box element has an ID of "box1": */
#box1 {
  /* Other styles for box1 */
  transform: rotate(360deg) scale(2); /* Apply both transformations on line 15 */
}

    /*----*/
}
--------------------------
Explanation:

Target element: The code assumes you're targeting an element with the ID "box1". Adjust the selector as needed if your box has a different ID or class.
Multiple transformations: The transform property can take multiple functions separated by spaces, applying them in the order they're listed.
Order of transformations: In this case, the rotation will be applied first, followed by the scaling. This means the box will be rotated 360 degrees (completing a full circle) and then doubled in size.
